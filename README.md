# pythonDiscordBot

This is a bot for discord using discord.py https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

It supports aliases, imgur, youtube, and basic twitch support. 

Imgur and youtube needs to be oauthed witch requires api keys and user authorization. To do so the bot has to be run in a terminal
to get those setup. I will make this an eaiser process sometime, maybe.
